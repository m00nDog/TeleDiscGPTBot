# TeleDiscGPTBot
Chat GPT bot for telegram and discord

in the same folder as the python file "telediscGPTbot.py" place a file with the name ".env" and include your telegram bot API key, discord bot API key, and OpenAI chat gpt API key.  This is a more secure way to call these keys into your python file and not have the keys live within the python code itself.

this code also uses the ChatGPT 4 model, and this is only available after requesting access, being waitlisted, and then finally granted access.  The ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo can be utilized instead if your OpenAI API key has not yet been granted access to ChatGPT 4.
